    "## Intro to Knowledge Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs are a way of storing and organizing complex information in a graph structure. In a knowledge graph, data is represented as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) that connect these nodes. This structure makes it easier to visualize and analyze connections between different pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a knowledge graph representing a power grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graph _nodes_ can represent components like transformers, substations, and generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graph _edges_ can represent relationships such as the connection between different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important to understand that in this context graph nodes are not the same as electrical buses / nodes. Every bus, branch, and piece of equipment is a node in the knowledge graph.\n",

    "## Intro to Typed Property Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality of the CIMantic Graphs interface is driven by a typed property graph interface in which the graph nodes and edges are strictly typed according to the particular object and its attributes and associations as given by UML structure of the Common Information Model. Typed property graphs are a specific kind of graph used in programming and database systems to model and manage complex data. Within the typed property graph, the following general rules apply:\n",
    "1. Nodes and Edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Nodes represent entities (like transformers, substations, or generators).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Edges represent the relationships between these entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Both nodes and edges can have properties. Properties are additional pieces of information such as names, capacity, or any other relevant attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For example, a node representing an `ACLineSegment` will have properties like name and length.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Each node and edge has a type that defines what kind of entity or relationship it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Types help in organizing and validating the data. For example, a node of type `ACLineSegment` might only have properties like name and length, while a node of type `PhotoVoltaicUnit` will have properties like name and rated capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure above, each of the graph nodes are an object with a strict datatype, such as `ACLineSegment`, `Feeder`, and `Terminal`. Only object types defined within the CIM profile selected by the user are supported within the typed property graph. The graph nodes are linked together with edges of strict typing with specific names for each association. So, the edge `ACLineSegment` --[`ConductingEquipment.Terminals`]--> `list(Terminal)` can only have a list of `Terminal` objects. A different object type, such as `Location` cannot be used in that edge."
