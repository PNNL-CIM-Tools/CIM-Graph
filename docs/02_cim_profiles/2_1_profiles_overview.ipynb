    "One of the common misconceptions regarding the CIM is that the entire information model must be adopted and implemented. As an enterprise-focused canonical information model, the full CIM covers an extremely broad range of aspects of modeling, operations, billing, asset management, and energy markets. Any given application or even an entire data-rich environment will only need a small subset of the full common information model. \n",

    "When choosing CIM for a particular project, application, and data integration effort, it is important to consider the particular use case, what functional objectives must be met, and what is the minimum number of attributes that must be modeled to meet the identified requirements. This section will briefly discuss some of the consideration involved in selecting a CIM profile, building a data profile, populating that profile with power system data, and then selecting a database structure to contain that data."
