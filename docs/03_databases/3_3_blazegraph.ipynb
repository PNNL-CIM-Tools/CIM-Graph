    "The triple-store database offers a semantic solution for data management. Unlike the relational database solution (which requires a DDL database schema), the triple-store database structure is comprised of resource descriptive framework (RDF) statements. These RDF statements take the form of subject (node), predicate (relation), object (node) that can be dynamically generated to form inter-related complex class structures. RDF Schema (RDFS) supports polymorphism concepts, provides a means to create graph constructs, and supports the concept of subgraphs so that partitioning of the graph space is possible. RDF can be specified in a variety of ways including XML, TTL, and JSON-LD. Other languages, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL), can be used to offer more sophisticated constraints and additional constructs for reasoning and inferencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RDF statement structure intuitively corresponds to the structure of object-attribute specifications used in CIM (e.g. `ACLineSegment` (subject) has an attribute `length` (predicate) with value `105 meters` (object)). The CIM supports translation of data structures directly into RDF with the ability to automate correlation of data. The CIMTool software supports translation of a CIM profile into RDFS and OWL. After ingesting the power system network model data and the RDFS / OWL structures from the data profile, the user can use a triple-store databased to correlate well-defined CIM structures with newly generated data automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using a triple-store database is that it directly supports CIM development.  It is highly agile and supports dynamic data structures generated by multiple developers. It is also supported by a standardized, mature language for specifying directed graph and hierarchical class structures as well as a standardized way to manage RDF data. RDF supports both type-checking and the Shapes Constraints Language (SHACL) for structure validation. The main disadvantage of triple-store is the risk for garbage-in-garbage-out (GIGO), meaning that without a well-thought-out strategy to support data management activities, maintenance can be difficult. Likewise, without a certain rigor for data contributors, dangling references or conflicts can appear in the database."
